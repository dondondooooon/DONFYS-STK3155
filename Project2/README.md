# Project 2: An Investigation on Classification and Regression Analysis, from Linear and Logistic Regression to Neural Networks

results
--------
Here you will find the plots for the results

saved_txt
--------
Here lies the .txt files for the exported files of the matrices for grid searching

neuralnetwork.py
--------
Here is the class NeuralNetwork defined.

franke_nn.py
--------
A python script that initializes the Franke function data set and uses the NeuralNetwork class to perform linear regression. This file also (if uncommented) optionally exports .txt files to be used for plotting the heatmaps for grid searches for the optimal parameters.

heatmap.py
--------
This is the script used to plot the heatmaps for grid searching.

plain_GD.py
--------
Script for plain gradient descent algorithm

momentum_GD.py
--------
Script for gradient descent with momentum algorithm
