In summary, you should perform an analysis of the results for OLS and Ridge
regression as function of the chosen learning rates, the number of mini-batches
and epochs as well as algorithm for scaling the learning rate. 
i.e:
    MSE vs different learning rates vs complexity (OLS)
    PLOTS
    MSE vs mini batches 
    MSE vs epochs with different learning rates
    MSE vs complexity for GD, GD w m, SGD, SGD w m for Franke

    GD_Franke: Code for GD on Franke function w/o momentum and fixed learning rate - DONE 
    GDM_Franke: Code for GD on Franke function w momentum and fixed learning rate - compare to above
    SGD_Franke: Code for SGD on Franke function w/o momentum, fixed learning rate, w epochs, mini batches 
    SGDM_Franke: Code for SGD on Franke function w momentum, fixed learning rate, w epochs, mini batches
